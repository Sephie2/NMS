### Extending the Base Range
The normal base computer radius is 300u from the base computer (which is the _center_ of the base), however it is possible to extend the range of a base by over three times this to 1000u. To do this, the boundary must first be unlocked by using a [Save Point](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/Save_Point "Save Point") or [Beacon](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/Save_Beacon "Save Beacon") within your base then reloading that save. Next, drop any structure or technology base building element (say a [Storage Container](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/Storage_Container "Storage Container") or a [Supply Depot](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/Supply_Depot "Supply Depot") or even a floor segment) at the edge of the base boundary but within the limits of the computer range. This will create a bubble of buildspace ~50u in radius at that location. This can be used to daisy chain up to 1000u from the original location, allowing additional hotspots to be accessed from a specific base location. Power and supply pipes of course will need to be run to all these remote locations from the main base site.
### Hotspot Classes
C-Class - 40% yield 
B-Class - 60% yield
A-Class - 80% yield
S-Class - 100% yield

The maximum yield of the class is only found at the very center. Which is why stacking yields the maximum result.

### Finding more hotspots
After finding a hotspot, but in the wrong class, try following along a cardinal direction, usually north or south, to find more of the same type. 

Hotspots are also usually clustered, with a mineral, a gas, and an electricity Hotspot in a triangle- or square-ish formation close to each other.
