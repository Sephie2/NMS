Naming Conventions: 
 - Stars: spectral class; Economy; Dist. from center
 - Planets: 

- run faster: melee attack + rocket boost = enhanced jump
- try to keep mining beam in the red without letting it overheat
- scan everything. Every plant, mineral, etc. to find out what the secondary drops are. You cannot get the secondary drop without scanning them first. If you scan everything, you get a huge bonus of nanites
- always mine with the smallest "bubble" possible, to get the most resources. Press [R] to make the mining laser small. Press [T] to make it bigger.
- always look for buried technology modules and damaged machinery (buried tech near it)
- if Traveler in Space Station, always give them 100 Nanites
- Hop in- and out of Ship to create a Restore Point. In Options -> Reload Restore Point to reload wares from Merchants and such
---
### The very Beginning
- find hole, mine some stuff, repair scanner, farm Sodium and Oxygen for survival
- find somewhere to hide, to recharge hazard protection
- build carbon nanotubes (carbon + ferrite dust) -> analysis visor in multitool, scanner

- scan everything. Every plant, mineral, etc. to find out what the secondary drops are. You cannot get the secondary drop without scanning them first.

- farm lots of Di-Hydrogen to make survival jelly's
- special oxygen-plants near ship
- cave-system near ship, contains cobalt and cave marrow (can be turned into sodium)
- farm 4-5k cobalt, bit of oxygen and sodium, di-hydrogen 

### Ship Quest
- hop into Ship. Auto-Repair-quest takes over
- make a portable refiner near ship. Refine Ferrite Dust into pure Ferrite. Stop at 50. Refine all your marrow bulb into Sodium. Max out on life-support jelly and 10 ion batteries for personal use (rest of sodium goes into repairing ship)
- entering the ship the second time starts the quest for Hermetic Seal. Shortly after, a strong storm spawns. 
- explore, have fun
- back to ship, cap out on ship fuel

- before taking off from the planet, have 1000 carbon, 1000 Ferrite Dust, 250+ Sodium for ship shield, 50+ cobalt

### First time in space
- awakening quest
- go to an asteroid field and mine asteroids for 10 minutes or more
- scan all the planets from space, look for planet for first base (resources)
- answering the signal unlocks quest for base computer. Go there and find the signal source -> first save beacon

### Base Quest
- before base command unit quest: dismantle rocket launcher for copper in refinery: 
	- altern. fix the terrain manipulator and find a copper mine with the scanner, then tag it and run there
- always look for buried technology modules and damaged machinery. **Need 15+ salvaged data** for Blueprints
- Refine Copper into Chromatic metal

- cash in all discoveries. need tons of nanites
- if we find a mining outpost station, guy in back sells components or blueprints
- buy Blueprints for **Advanced Mining Laser, and optionally Teleport Receiver, Waveform Recycler, Shield Lattice**
- if not, those can be bought in the Anomaly later

- **build first base module, deploy it, interact with it**
- when building the first base, there is going to be another big storm. We only need to stand under a roof to avoid damage
- **build Research Unit**
	- buy Blueprints: **Base Teleport Module, etc.**
- Built Base Teleporter, 2 Batteries, 2 Solar Cells, and Biofuel Reactor and connect them. Put 10 Carbon into the Reactor for quest, then scrap the Reactor. 
- Quest sends you to Space Station

### First Space Station Visit
- buy 5 Micro-Processors from the GTN, and optionally Advanced Mining Laser, and optionally Teleport Receiver, Waveform Recycler, Shield Lattice from some person
- Talk to Aliens, but NONE of them must be in booths (sell stuff)
- **On Each Station, Upgrade a Cargo or Technology Slot**
- **install Oxygen Recylcer on backpack, shield lattice**

- Back in Base, Computer will give new quest to find an emergency signal. This quest lets you build a Hyperdrive (needs 5 Microprocessors)
- With Hyperdrive installed, in orbit, do a Ping to find Antimatter trace. This leads to a Base somewhere. This Base has some eggs around. These are valuable (money or nanites), but looting them spawns monsters. We can make medium sized holes at an angle below them, and from within, get the eggs

### First Hyperjump
There are 3 Alien Races. Geck, Korvack, Viking. Visit a system from a different race.
- follow Quest, then space station. 

- **On Each New System, Upgrade a Cargo or Technology Slot in Space Station and Anomaly**
- Check out Modules for Sale, A or S rank. 

- Follow Quest to find a broken Ship. Repair Beacon, Build a Save Beacon or Base. The Ship will respawn in 4-5 ingame hours.
- To Repair the ship, at a minimum, needs Launch Thrusters and Pulse Engine to get it up to space
	- Sell Ship. Then go to 
	- Ship upgrade module vendor, sell ship modules for Nanites
	- Go to GTN to sell Ship Parts for credits

- After going back into space, Nada will call. He will summon the Space Anomaly. Before going there, farm 30 - 60 Salvaged Data from Buried Technology Caches
	- Talk to Selene, the Haz-Mat Suit Vendor and **buy Haz-Mat Gauntlets, Personal Refiner and Neural Stimulator**
	- Hyperion is the Starship Module Dealer. Buy **Economy Scanner, Positron Ejector, Fragment Supercharge, Ablative Armor, Efficient Thrusters, Launch Autocharger, optionally: Cadmium Drive, Emerald Drive, Indium Drive**
	- Ios the Multi-Tool-Upgrade Vendor. Buy **Amplified Cartidges**
	- Construction Research: **Medium Refiner, Large Refiner, GTN Terminal, Electrical Cloaking Unit, etc. **

Tipp: Irradiated Planets have underwater plants that usually have Oxygen as secondary drop. Scan, then shoot from ship

Back in Base: Storage Module
Build 3 Medium Refiners and 2 Large Refiners
	- Medium 1: Cobalt + Oxygen = Ionized Cobalt
	- Medium 2: Salt or Chlorine + Oxygen = more Chlorine

Make and sell Chlorine and Ionized Cobalt until about 30 Million Credits. Buy a little  S class ship 
- make Ionized Cobalt, and turn Ionized Cobalt into more cobalt, etc. until we get about 8 or more stacks of Cobalt to crash markets
- upgrade Hyperdrive and make a bunch of Warp Cells

### Easy Credits and Nanites
- upgrade the Multi-Tool Scanner with 3 S-Class upgrades, bought from scanning all animals on a few planets (rewards 1500-3000 nanites)
- the upgrades will increase credit payout. Try to use a supercharged slot to supercharge one of those, and get +30.000% payout on all the things, then scan little rocks for 150.000 credits per rock. 
- This way you can take your time exploring all the planets in each system

### Very Fast Exo-suit upgrading without warping 50 times
- needs an Exocraft unlocked, which should happen very early on after building the first base; continue the main story, then click on the Base Main Computer to start a new quest to uncover more archive data. This quest will include the first Exocraft blueprint. 
- go to the Anomaly and buy the Scanner and Advanced Scanner upgrades (costs Nanites)
- back on the Planet, with the Exocraft Station build on your base, summon or go to your Exocraft. In it, go to Scanner -> Scan for Pod -> go there and repair it, to get a new technology or cargo slot for your Exosuit -> Repeat. 

### Best Ship Weapons
Positron Ejector ("Shotgun") and Infra-Knife-Accelerator ("Knifes go brrrrrrrrr"). Since weapon mods are additive, it is much better to add **The Weapon itself** to a supercharged slot. 

### Best Multitool Weapons
Scatter Blaster ("Shotgun"), Pulse Blaster ("Shots go brrrrrrrr") are the most powerful, but use Ammunition. 

### The Classic: The Galactic Economy Crash Loop
**Pre-Requisites**
- Requires ~8 or 9 full stacks (9999) of Cobalt. To get this, we need at least 40.000 Oxygen. To get there, find a planet that contains Oxygen, see [Planetary Resources]. Find an Oxygen Hotspot at level C or higher. Don't bother looking for A or S class hotspot. Build a base nearby and 2 stacks of 4 Gas Harvesters on top of each other (for a total of 8). Each Harvester gets one battery and 2 solar cells, as well as 10 to 15 Resource Storage. Metal Plates can be bought in space stations and the traders there. 
- We also need about 1000+ Cobalt to start with, found usually in underground rocks. 
- Refine 2 Cobalt + 2 Oxygen to 5 Ionized Cobalt
- Refine 1 Ionized Cobalt + 1 Oxygen = 6 Ionized Cobalt
- now can multiply Ionized Cobalt by adding Oxygen until we have 4 or 5 stacks of Ionized Cobalt. 
- Refine the Ionized Cobalt (without Oxygen) to twice that amount of Cobalt. 
- Since the GTN in every station also sells Cobalt, we can sell our stacks to crash the economy, then buy it back, also visiting traders. 

- summon space anomaly
	- Go to Anomaly, upgrade Exo-suite
- Space Station -> Upgrade Technology or Cargo Slots
	- upgrade Exo-Suite Slot
	- check upgrade module vendors for S class Modules. Get 3 S-Class Hyperdrive Modules for Ship, 3 Pulse-Engine Modules
	- check multi-tool cabinet
	- check back-room for travelers
	- loot items that are lying around, like glowing cubes and disks

- At around 50+ Million, start buying cheap B, A and S-Class Ships. Salvage the components inside, then sell ship and modules for nanites. Can result in **Storage Augmentations**. Never sell those

- Go to next System and Repeat

### The Freighter Encounter
- battle Pirates, do not shoot the Freighter. Alternative: land space station, pop in-out of ship, get back into space and the pirates are gone. 
- Freighter Commander will give reward. 
- After docking to the Freighter, scan it with Discovery Scanner. Do not get the first Freighter for free, get materials instead. 

**Second Freighter will be a Captial Ship**

Back to Galactic Economy Crash Loop

4-5 hours after the last Freighter Encounter will result in a new Encounter. This time a capital ship. 
- **Immediately dock at space station and create a Restore Point**
- Go to Freighter and Check it out. Not S Class? Reload. Might take an hour or more. Freighter might change location after re-load. 


Back to Galactic Economy Crash Loop. Until we collect all the Traveler Glyphs 

### Agriculture
- Collect lots of Buried Data Caches, then buy out all the Agriculture Mods in the Anomaly
- in a Viking System, buy a Viking Dagger from a ship guy in orbit or on a planetary station
- collect all the plant fibers from different systems. 600 Fc, 600 Mi, 350 Sb, 350 Fa, 60 Mo, 300 Cc, 140 Gr, 400 So
- Go to Cartographic Vendor and buy 5 Alien Cartographic Data. Make a Safe-point in ship.
	- use them and hope for a Monolith. On Monolith: Answer question correctly or reload
	- in a Viking System, give the Dagger to find Portal Location.
	- on Portal Location, Make a Base. Then Power it up. 


S-Class Multi-Tool: 
![](img/Pasted%20image%2020231018204222.png)
- hop in ship and straight up, looking at the portal. look back down, right side of the ring is a bunch of comm-beacons.
- There should be a base: Communication Station. Go there, then to the right side, up a hill, is another station with a bunch of beacons. 
- go in to the weapon terminal

And another (in space station)
![](img/ancient%20glyph%20portal%20address%20for%20s-class%20exotool.png)


### The Freighter upgrades
- best refer to another tutorial

- kill other Freigthers (the modules to the sides) to farm **Salvage Frigate Modules**
- don't shoot the little ships; 
- Hide in Space Station to reset aggo
- Need around 60 Frigate Modules

- Remove all the rooms in the Freighter
- Go to Center console in Freighter to buy the Modules
